      I got placed after my B-tech in a company name Caerus Infosystems, which is a Bengaluru based start-up.I started my career as 
      a manual tester.As it was a start-up we got to learn so much.We started from the scratch.I also worked on MIT- app inventor a tool 
      for developing websites.I got to be a part of a project named Eazycom, which is an app simlar to any online grocery app.

 Later, I shifted to Caerus Skillmatic India Pvt Ltd with a tag line "skill-up,scale-up" , is a sister compant of Caerus Infosystems.Skillmatic developed an
 online learning platform, just like Byjus.It connect various people at one place.Here I happened to write user 
 stories,test cases,test scenarios and also did bug tracking.This was very interesting as I used many ways to track the defects.
 But I always wanted to be a part of development team, So I joined MSIT to dive deep and learn more techinal skills.
